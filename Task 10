Normalizingdatabases usingfunctionaldependencies upto Third Normal Form

Aim: To normalize the below relation and create the simplified table with suitable constraint.

Procedure:
Normalize the given relation and create simplified tables with suitable constraints, we need to identify the functional dependencies and separate them into different tables. Normalization involves breaking down the data into smaller, related tables to minimize data redundancy and maintain data integrity. Let's identify the functional dependencies:
Functional Dependency:

BoardID → Name, Address, Contact_No
TeamID → TName, Coach, Captain
PlayerID → PFName, PLName, Age, PDateofBirth, PlayingRole, email, contact_no, Batting, Bowling
MatchID → Match_Date, Time1, Result, GroundID
GroundID → GName, Location, Capacity
UmpireID → UFName, ULName, UAge, UDateofBirth, Country, Uemail, Ucontact_no


Now, we can create simplified tables:
CricketBoard (BoardID [PK], Name, Address, Contact_No)
CricketTeam (TeamID [PK], TName, Coach, Captain)
CricketPlayer (PlayerID [PK], TeamID [FK], PFName, PLName, Age, PDateofBirth, PlayingRole, email, contact_no, Batting, Bowling)
CricketMatch (MatchID [PK], TeamID [FK], Match_Date, Time1, Result, GroundID [FK])
CricketGround (GroundID [PK], GName, Location, Capacity)
CricketUmpire (UmpireID [PK], UFName, ULName, UAge, UDateofBirth, Country, Uemail, Ucontact_no)
In these tables, [PK] denotes the primary key, [FK] denotes the foreign key, and suitable constraints should be added to maintain data integrity. 

Create tables for all non-prime attributes using α+
α+ (Alpha Plus) allows to group attributes based on their functional dependencies and candidate keys. And create tables for each set of attributes that functionally depend on a candidate key. The candidate keys in this case are BoardID, TeamID, PlayerID, MatchID, and UmpireID.

Board Table: BoardID (PK),  Name, Address, Contact_No
Team Table: TeamID (PK), TName, Coach, Captain
Player Table: PlayerID (PK), TeamID (FK), PFName, PLName, Age, PDateofBirth, PlayingRole, 
Email, contact_no, Batting, Bowling
Match Table: MatchID (PK), TeamID (FK), Match_Date, Time1, Result
Ground Table: GroundID (PK), GName, Location, Capacity
Umpire Table: UmpireID (PK), UFName, ULName, UAge, UDateofBirth, Country, Uemail, Ucontact_no

Create additional tables to represent transitive dependencies.
Already addressed transitive dependencies in previous normalization steps by introducing the MatchVenue table for the transitive dependency between MatchID and GroundID through the Result attribute.
MatchVenue Table: MatchID (PK, FK), GroundID (FK)
First Normal Form:
The given relation into the First Normal Form (1NF), to need to ensure that each attribute (column) contains atomic (indivisible) values, and there are no repeating groups or arrays. 
Based on the provided relation, it appears that each attribute already contains atomic values, so there are no repeating groups to eliminate.
Second Normal Form:
To determine whether the given relation is in the Second Normal Form (2NF), we need to check two conditions:
The relation must already be in 1NF (First Normal Form).
All non-prime attributes (attributes not part of any candidate key) must be fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.
First, let's identify the potential candidate key(s) from the given relation based on functional dependencies:

It appears that the potential candidate keys could be:
BoardID
TeamID
PlayerID
MatchID
UmpireID

Next, we need to check if all non-prime attributes are fully functionally dependent on their respective candidate key(s).
Third Normal Form:
To determine whether the given relation is in the Third Normal Form (3NF), need to check two conditions:
The relation must already be in the Second Normal Form (2NF).
There should be no transitive dependencies between non-prime attributes and candidate keys.

The given relation satisfies the conditions of the Second Normal Form (2NF). Now, let's check for transitive dependencies:
Now, let's analyze each functional dependency and check for transitive dependencies:
BoardID → Name, Address, Contact_No
There are no transitive dependencies in this case, as Name, Address, and Contact_No are directly dependent on BoardID.

TeamID → TName, Coach, Captain
There are no transitive dependencies here either, as TName, Coach, and Captain are directly dependent on TeamID.

PlayerID → PFName, PLName, Age, PDateofBirth, PlayingRole, email, contact_no, Batting, Bowling
There are no transitive dependencies for PlayerID, as all the mentioned attributes are directly dependent on PlayerID.
MatchID → Match_Date, Time1, Result, GroundID
There is a transitive dependency between MatchID and GroundID through the Result attribute. To resolve this, we create a new table called MatchVenue:
MatchVenue (MatchID [PK], GroundID [FK])
GroundID → GName, Location, Capacity
There are no transitive dependencies for GroundID, as GName, Location, and Capacity are directly dependent on GroundID.
UmpireID → UFName, ULName, UAge, UDateofBirth, Country, Uemail, Ucontact_no
There are no transitive dependencies for UmpireID, as UFName, ULName, UAge, UDateofBirth, Country, Uemail, and Ucontact_no are directly dependent on UmpireID.
With the introduction of the MatchVenue table to resolve the transitive dependency, the relation now satisfies the conditions of the Third Normal Form (3NF).





















Result: 
Thus the normalization of the given relation is created the simplified tables with suitable constraint successfully.
